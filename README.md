I neede the count of bars of the Songs of my band to create a setlist of click-tracks for the next live-gig. 
I new the tempo (BPM) and the song length (minutes / seconds). So I created a little "Bar Calculator".
Than I added a Tap-Tempo button (could be handy).
Than I thought, maybe integrate a click Metronome, cause you allready did the math...
...to be continued ;)

It is by far not very accurate and there are some usabillity meehhs. But it it fun and I learn alot on the way.

Roadmap:
- create Android App
- make it look better
- add functions
- create iOS App
- ...

Feel free to build your own with this one as a starting point.
Kind regards ;)
